Wallnut is a simple application which is used to change desktop image on your Mac OS X machine.

To change desktop image you can do two things:

1. Drag and drop an image on its dock icon.

2. Drag and drop a folder containing images on its dock icon. 

In 2nd case it will change the wallpaper by randomly picking an image from the folder dropped, after certain time interval. 

Right now only these time intervals are supported:

1. 15 secs (default)
2. 30 secs
3. 60 secs

These time interval options are visible from 'Repeat After Secs' menu item in dock menu.

The image types supported currently are:

1. jpeg
2. png
